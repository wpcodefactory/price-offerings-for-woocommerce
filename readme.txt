Name Your Price for WooCommerce is an intuitive plugin designed to give your customers the flexibility to set their own price for your products. Whether it's for open pricing, making a donation, or negotiating a preferred price, this plugin empowers your customers to choose how much they can pay.

The plugin is easy to use and integrates seamlessly with your WooCommerce store, requiring minimal setup so you can be up & running in a few clicks.

What the plugin can help you with?

1. Allow customers to suggest their own prices.
2. Define minimum prices to ensure profitability.
3. Negotiate by accept, reject, or counter offer.
4. Stay informed using email notifications for all updates
5. Enhance customer satisfaction and drive more sales by providing a personalized shopping experience with open pricing.

## How it Works ##

The plugin adds a customizable "Make an Offer" button to your WooCommerce product pages. When a customer clicks the button, a form pops up where they can enter their suggested price, email, and an optional message.

You'll receive an email with their offer, which will also be saved in the backend price offers dashboard. From there, you can take actions like rejecting, accepting, or countering the offer.

Let's get into each feature in more details.
