Allows your customers to start product price negotiations with you.

== Description ==

**Price Offers for WooCommerce** plugin allows your customers to start product price negotiations with you. The plugin allows them to suggest their price for your products. Then you can reject, accept, counter their offer.

### &#9881; How it Works ###

The plugin adds customizable "Make an offer" button to the frontend product pages of your WooCommerce store. After customer clicks the button, modal form is displayed, where he can enter his suggested price, reply email, optional message etc. You will then receive an email with the price offer and the offer will also be saved in backend price offers dashboard. Then you can perform price offer actions (reject, accept, counter, etc.).

### &#9989; Features ###

* **Exclude** selected products from price offers, e.g., **out of stock** products, products with **non-empty price**, etc.
* Set custom **label**, **CSS class**, **style** and **position** for the "Make an offer" button on frontend.
* Customize the **frontend form**: select enabled and required fields, set price input options, labels, notices, styles, etc.
* Set recipient(s), subject, heading, content template for the price offers **emails**.
* Choose columns you want to see in **admin price offers history** for the product.
* Available price offer **actions**: Reject, Accept, Counter, etc.
* The plugin is **"High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS)"** compatible.
* And more...
